@chapter Changes from 5.1.8 to 5.1.9 (January 2015)
@anchor{#changes-from-5.1.8-to-5.1.9-january-2015}
The main developers this time were: Trent Gamblin, SiegeLord, Elias
Pschernig.

Core:

@itemize
@item
Fix OSX backend on OSX 10.10 (lordnoriyuki).

@item
Simplify how sub-bitmaps interact with their parent bitmaps. You can now
destroy a sub-bitmap at any time (not only before the parent is
destroyed). Additionally, when the parent is converted using
@code{al_convert_bitmap}, all the sub-bitmaps are also automatically
converted.

@item
Switch to using unicode Win32 (e.g.@ this fixes using
@code{al_set_window_title} with unicode strings).

Add some Linux WM hints so make Allegro windows work more smoothly
(especially with Unity).

@end itemize

Graphics:

@itemize
@item
Add block compression pixel formats
(ALLEGRO_PIXEL_FORMAT_COMPRESSED_RGBA_DXT1/DXT3/DXT5) for compressed
video bitmaps. This includes an API to fetch compressed block size
(@code{al_get_pixel_block_width/height/size}) as well as API to load and
unload compressed bitmap data without paying a runtime compression cost
(@code{al_lock_bitmap_blocked}). Unfortunately, due to patent concerns
this last feature is disabled for OpenGL (if you thinks those concerns
don't apply to you, you can enable it by passing
@code{-DWANT_OPENGL_S3TC_LOCKING=1} to cmake).

@item
Make real fullscreen modes work on OS X again. May not be perfect still.
(thanks to SDL).

@end itemize

is still the first joystick. Supports two analog sticks and 10 buttons

Shaders:

@itemize
@item
Revamped shader API. The shader API is now part of the core library, and

ALLEGRO_PROGRAMMABLE_PIPELINE.
